# Unofficial Playit-Datacenter Checker
This is an **unofficial** program i've made, that allow playit users to checks if a datacenter is down or not. <br>
The way it works is very simple: using ping on every datacenters address! <br>
I have made a discord bot for it, you will find the link in this github repository. <br>
